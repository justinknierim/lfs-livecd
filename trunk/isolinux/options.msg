To use a framebuffer console, type "linux vga=xxx"
where xxx is a screen resolution.

Examples:

795 = 1280x1024x24
794 = 1280x1024x16
792 = 1024x768x24
791 = 1024x768x16
789 = 800x600x24
788 = 800x600x16

To use a kernel equipped with speakup drivers, type
"speakup" and any options for that kernel, such as
"vga=15492" for 60 lines and 132 columns.

nALFS & ALFS profile for LFS 6.1
(A tool for automating a Linux From Scratch installation)

jhalfs
(A tool for extracting commands from the Linux From Scratch book and creating
Makefiles that can download, check and build each LFS package for you.)

CONFIGURING X
===========================
The Live CD attempts to configure X for your video card automatically. The
process may fail if you have more than one video card, or if your video card
doesn't support 24-bit color depth.

You still have to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf using vim, joe or nano in order to
configure the available video modes (otherwise the highest resolution with
60 Hz refresh rate will be used). Instructions for doing that are found in
the BLFS book, under the section Configuring Xorg:

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/installing.html#xorg

When you are finished, run startx.

CUSTOMIZING THE CD CONTENTS
===========================
It is possible to burn a customized version of the official Linux From
Scratch LiveCD, with your own files added. To do that, follow the
instructions below.

* Burn the official CD in multi session mode:
    cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom -v -multi -tao lfslivecd-[version].iso

* Prepare a directory with the files you want to add, delete or change:
    mkdir second-session && cd second-session
    vim path/to/new-file
    vim path/to/file-to-be-changed
    touch path/to/.wh.file-to-be-deleted
    cd ..

* Make an image contatining those files:
    mkisofs -M lfslivecd-[version].iso \
        -C `cdrecord -msinfo dev=/dev/cdrom` \
	-R -o second-session.iso second-session

* Append the image you just created to the official Linux From Scratch
  LiveCD:
    cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom -v -multi -tao second-session.iso


AUTOSSHD
============================
It is possible to start the sshd daemon automatically upon boot. To do that,
you have to customize the CD as described above. Add the following files:

* /.autosshd
    This is the file that indicates that the sshd daemon should be
    started automatically. It should be empty.

* /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    Add your public key to that file in order to be able to log in.
    Alternatively, modify /etc/shadow.

* /etc/shadow
    Edit this file if you want to allow root to login using a password via
    ssh. It is more secure to use public key based authentication instead.

* /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
    Create those files as described in the ssh-keygen(1) manual page. If you
    don't fo that, random host keys will be generated for you automatically
    during the boot process. This is less secure, because you can't verify
    them.

* /etc/sysconfig/network-devices/ifconfig.eth0
    Configure a known static IP address there, as described in the LFS book,
    section "7.12. Configuring the network Script".

* /etc/udev/rules.d/50-network.rules
    Create an empty file in order to prevent udev from running dhcpcd.

INTERNATIONALIZATION
================
It is possible to specify the locale using the bootloader prompt, like this:

  linux LANG=es_ES@euro

The CD tries to guess the proper screen font and keymap based on this
information. If the guess is wrong, you can override it by adding the
following parameters:

  KEYMAP: specifies the console keymap(s) to load (actually the arguments to
  the "loadkeys" program separated by the "+" sign), e.g: KEYMAP=es+euro1

  LEGACY_CHARSET: sometimes a ready-made UTF-8 keymap is not available and
  must be obtained by converting an existing keymap from this charset to UTF-8.
  E.g.: LEGACY_CHARSET=iso-8859-15
  This parameter is not used in non-UTF-8 locales.

  FONT: specifies the screen font to set (actually, the arguments to the
  "setfont" program separated by the "+" sign), e.g:
  FONT=LatArCyrHeb-16+-m+8859-15

  XKEYMAP: the keymap to use with X window system, e.g. XKEYMAP=us_intl

Alternatively, these items can be configured interactively using dialog-based
interface if the locale is not specified on the boot prompt.

For some locales (e.g. lv_LV.ISO-8859-13) there is no valid console keymap,
but there is a keymap for X. In this case, the only solution is to use X.
Languages that need special input method software (e.g. Chinese, Japanese
and Korean) are not supported yet.

While this CD configures the LANG environment variable, console font and
keymap for you, it's your responsibility to configure other locale-dependent
parameters manually. You may want to configure character sets for SAMBA in
/etc/samba/smb.conf, and to explicitly specify the "iocharset" and "codepage"
options when mounting filesystems with Windows origin (e.g., vfat and isofs).

The CD contains TrueType fonts that cover the orthography of most of European
and some Asian languages. No additional configuration is required in order to
use these fonts.

Use of this LiveCD with Chinese, Japanese or Korean language requires that
your monitor has at least 96 pixels per inch in order for hieroglyphs to
be recognizable (i.e., at least 12 pixels high). This means the following
minimum resolution:

    15" => 1152x864
    17" => 1280x1024
    19" => 1400x1050
    20" => 1600x1200

If your monitor cannot handle such resolution, edit the
/etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc file with vim, nano or joe, and add the -dpi 96
parameter to the X server command line there.

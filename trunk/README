LFS LiveCD

------------------

I. Introduction

  There have been many livecds (aka bootcds) made and used within
the LFS community. Of particular note were Chris Lingard's and
Jeremy Utley's. By some random freak of chance, however, and perhaps a
bit of persistence on my part, a cd of mine was chosen to be used as the
'official' LFS cd with the release of LFS 6.0.

  I based much of my work on the ideas and work of Chris and Jeremy,
and from suggestions and comments from various LFSers, but the cd has been
still largely my work.  However, for the idea of an official cd to survive
and grow within the community, help and ideas need to continue to come
from more than just one source.

  My intention with the LFS livecd project, then, is to devise a
framework, a usable setting in which others may contribute and build cds
that live up to the official standard.

II. Software

  An official LFS livecd will contain the following software as a minimum:

An LFS base system

An HTML version of the LFS book

The X Window System Environment

Web Tools
  * Wget
  * Lynx
  * Irssi
  * Firefox
  * Xchat

Text Editors
  * Vim
  * Nano

Network Tools
  * SSH Server and Client
  * NFS Server and Client
  * Smbmount (mount.cifs) for Windows shares
  * Subversion
  * Dhcpcd (DHCP client)

Filesystem Programs
  * Reiserfsprogs
  * Xfsprogs

III. Building the livecd using these Makefiles

  Before you begin building the livecd, you should make sure of the following:

* The kernel running on your host system should be the same version for the
  target cd. We need this so that Xorg compiles and runs correctly. This
  version of the livecd uses linux-2.6.10.

* These Makefiles rely heavily on an active internet connection.

* Verify that this directory is called 'lfs-livecd' and is located in the 
  top of your lfs partition.  For example, if your lfs partition is mounted
  at /mnt/lfs this directory should be /mnt/lfs/lfs-livecd. You can change
  the name of this directory if you like, but if you do, be sure to edit the
  ROOT variable in top-level Makefile to match (include the beginning '/'). 

  To start the build, simply run:

	make

  If you run into an Error while building, you _should_ be able to resume
  where you left off after you adjust the build to remove the error. To do
  this, simply run 'make' again. If for some reason you want to build just
  one package (at one particular stage of the build) you will need to specify
  which package to build:

  1) To build a package for the /tools directory (corresponding to chapter 5
     in the LFS Book), you would run: make lfs-[package-name]

  2) To build a package for the final system, (the chroot environment) you
     would run: make [package-name]

  Following the examples above should properly set up the environment (ie.,
  switching to the lfs user for packages built for the /tools dir, and entering
  chroot to build packages for the final system.)

  That is why there are 'double' targets for packages in the main Makefile. One
  set of targets are targets that you can directly call for the sake of building
  just that package in the proper environment, and one set of targets
  (lfs-[package-name]-scpt or ch-[package-name]) are targets that should only be
  called by the make process internally because they expect the environment to
  be already set up correctly.

  I have tried to make the Makefiles as build friendly as possible, however
  this being my first real attempt at scripted builds via Makefiles, there
  are likely many improvements that could (and should!) be made to them.

IV. Basic Installation Steps

  I've moved this section from the README and placed it online. You can read
it here for now: http://linuxfromscratch.org/~jhuntwork/livecd/

  The purpose of the page linked above is to provide general notes for the
techniques used in producing the Official LFS LiveCD.

I. Introduction

  There have been many LiveCDs (aka BootCDs) made and used within
the LFS community. Of particular note were Chris Lingard's and
Jeremy Utley's. By some random freak of chance, however, and perhaps a
bit of persistence on my part, a CD of mine was chosen to be used as the
'Official' LFS CD with the release of LFS 6.0.

  I based much of my work on the ideas and work of Chris and Jeremy,
and from suggestions and comments from various LFS users, but the original
CD had still been largely my work.  However, for the idea of an official CD
to survive and grow within the community, help and ideas need to continue to
come from more than just one source.

  My intention with the LFS LiveCD project, then, was to devise a
framework, a usable setting in which others may contribute and build CDs
that live up to the official standard. Originally, the idea was just to keep
config files and a list of required packages in a Subversion repository. What
actually happened was that a fully automated scripting system was devised
specifically for the purpose of building the LiveCD iso. This allows both an
easily repeatable way of building the CD and a means to track its configuration
and history.

  Many thanks to all who have contributed to the production of these Makefiles
(and the CDs they in turn produce) by either suggestions, ideas, support, or
submitted edits.

II. Using the Makefiles

A. Configuring the Environment

  You should visually inspect the main Makefile, the one in the same directory
as this README before attempting to run the scripts. There are a few variables
that you may want to customize to meet the needs of your own particular setup
and for the type of CD you are hoping to produce. Here's a list of the main
variables to look for:

* LFS-ARCH
  This variable sets the architecture of the CD you are attempting to build.
The scripts assume that you are building the CD on such a host as well. At
this time, possible values are 'x86', 'ppc' or 'sparc'.

* VERSION
  This variable will be used in various places throughout the build and
should equal the version of the CD you intend to build. If you are building
this CD for personal use, you can enter anything here. LFS LiveCD editors will
follow a specific versioning scheme.

* KVERS
  This is the version of the Linux kernel to include on the CD

* MP
  This is the Mount Point, the directory that you will be using to house the
build as it runs. These scripts (this entire directory and its sub-directories)
should be placed inside the MP directory and run from there. Default is
/mnt/lfs.

* ROOT
  This signifies the root-point of the build scripts. In other words, this
is the name of the actual directory containing the build scripts. Default is
/lfs-livecd. If you accept the defaults for both this variable and MP, then
this directory and all its sub-directories should exist as 'lfs-livecd' within
the direcotry '/mnt/lfs'. It is important that this variable have a leading
'/' as it is referenced by the scripts in both the host environment and the
chroot environment.

* PM
  This is the level of parallel building you want make to use for each
package. Default is -j3, but you may wish to increase or decrease it slightly
as the case may be.

Any of the other variables could be changed, but that isn't recommended. Some
of them are crucial to the successful building of the CD, especially the ones
containing environment variables.

B. Running the Scripts

  Building the CD could be as simple as the following:

mkdir /mnt/lfs
cd /mnt/lfs
svn co svn://svn.linuxfromscratch.org/livecd/[path of repo] lfs-livecd
(or, 'tar -xjf [path to tarball]'if you have downloaded a tarball of these
scripts)
cd /mnt/lfs/lfs-livecd
make

  The above example makes use of the default variables for $(MP) and $(ROOT).

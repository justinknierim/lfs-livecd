NOTE: Items marked with a single star can wait for any time.
      Items marked with a double star should be done before release.

* Package up kernel source and upload to mirrors (will do this after we release, along with branching and tagging in the repo)
** i18n READMEs 
** nALFS profile
** New shutdown scripts to handle unmounts of drives, stopping of services, if they were started, etc.
** Background for xfce
** Add some Greek TrueType fonts.
* Remove Bitstream Vera
* Find out exact requirements for Intel framebuffer
* Fonts is xterm *slightly* too big? Any harm in reducing size by a point or two?
* Get the changes to the bootscripts installation changed upstream so that all we need is a make install-livecd again.
* Upgrade the scripts to be more fluid, understandable, ie, use of functions

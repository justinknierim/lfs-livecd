The fakecd.iso.head file is stored in pregenerated binary form in order
to avoid breakage that can be caused by new cdrtools. Append a single
file compressed by mkzftree to it, and adjust DWORDs at offsets mentioned below
in order to get a valid iso image containing that single file as /root.ext2.

DWORDs to change:

Offset 0x8050: volume size in 2K blocks, little-endian
Offset 0x8054: volume size in 2K blocks, big-endian
Offset 0xb8f8: compressed length, little-endian
Offset 0xb8fc: compressed length, big-endian
Offset 0xb973: uncompressed length, little-endian
Offset 0xb977: uncompressed length, big-endian

Uncompressed length can be found at offset 8 in the compressed file, in the
little-endian form.

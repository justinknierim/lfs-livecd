To use a framebuffer console, type "linux vga=xxx"
where xxx is a screen resolution.

Examples:

795 = 1280x1024x24
794 = 1280x1024x16
792 = 1024x768x24
791 = 1024x768x16
789 = 800x600x24
788 = 800x600x16

To enable expert mode type "expert" anywhere after
"linux". This will disable module loading and will
not attempt to bring up your network.

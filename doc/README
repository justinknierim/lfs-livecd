CONFIGURING X
===========================
The Live CD attempts to configure X for your video card automatically. The
process may fail if you have more than one video card, or if your video card
doesn't support 24-bit color depth.

You still have to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf using vim, joe or nano in order to
configure the keyboard layout and available video modes (otherwise the US
English keyboard layout and the highest resolution with 60 Hz refresh rate
will be used). Instructions for doing that are found in the BLFS book, under
the section Configuring Xorg:

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/installing.html#xorg

When you are finished, run startx.

NOTE: The default Window Manager is xfce which is intuitive and graphically
pleasing. If you prefer something more minimal, edit the file ~/.xinitrc to
read 'exec ion' or 'exec twm'.

CUSTOMIZING THE CD CONTENTS
===========================
It is possible to burn a customized version of the official Linux From
Scratch LiveCD, with your own files added. To do that, follow the
instructions below.

* Burn the official CD in multi session mode:
    cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom -v -multi -tao lfslivecd-x86-1-[version].iso

* Prepare a directory with the files you want to add, delete or change:
    mkdir second-session && cd second-session
    vim path/to/new-file
    vim path/to/file-to-be-changed
    touch path/to/.wh.file-to-be-deleted
    cd ..

* Make an image contatining those files:
    mkisofs -M lfslivecd-x86-6.1-1-[version].iso \
        -C `cdrecord -msinfo dev=/dev/cdrom` \
	-R -o second-session.iso second-session

* Append the image you just created to the official Linux From Scratch
  LiveCD:
    cdrecord dev=/dev/cdrom -v -multi -tao second-session.iso


AUTOSSHD
============================
It is possible to start the sshd daemon automatically upon boot. To do that,
you have to customize the CD as described above. Add the following files:

* /.autosshd
    This is the file that indicates that the sshd daemon should be
    started automatically. It should be empty.

* /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
    Add your public key to that file in order to be able to log in.
    Alternatively, modify /etc/shadow.

* /etc/shadow
    Edit this file if you want to allow root to login using a password via
    ssh. It is more secure to use public key based authentication instead.

* /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
    Create those files as described in the ssh-keygen(1) manual page. If you
    don't fo that, random host keys will be generated for you automatically
    during the boot process. This is less secure, because you can't verify
    them.

* /etc/sysconfig/network-devices/ifconfig.eth0
    Configure a known static IP address there, as described in the LFS book,
    section "7.12. Configuring the network Script".

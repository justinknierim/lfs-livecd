* Package up kernel source and upload to mirrors
* i18n READMEs
* nALFS profile
* New shutdown scripts to handle unmounts of drives, stopping of services, if they were started, etc.
* Decide upon the default timezone in the Makefile. GMT? (Fine with me - JH)
* Menus and background for xfce
* Add some Greek TrueType fonts.
* Remove Bitstream Vera, adjust /etc/fonts/fonts.conf accordingly
* Ask someone how to use USB to serial converters. Add support to the kernel.
* Find out exact requirements for Intel framebuffer
* Find a good way to run updatedb before the iso is burned (CD is now writable - so maybe we can just let the user run it himself? :) JH)
* Fonts is xterm *slightly* too big? Any harm in reducing size by a point or two?

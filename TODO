* Package up kernel source and upload to mirrors
* i18n READMEs
* udev rules for mice. Create a /dev/mouse symlink to /dev/input/mice?
* nALFS profile
* New shutdown scripts to handle unmounts of drives, stopping of services, if they were started, etc.
* Decide upon the default timezone in the Makefile. GMT? (Fine with me - JH)
* Create .xinitrc file for root and choose default wm, probably xfce.
* Menus and background for xfce
* Add some Greek TrueType fonts.
* Remove Bitstream Vera, adjust /etc/fonts/fonts.conf accordingly
* Ask someone how to use USB to serial converters. Add support to the kernel.
* Find out why via-agp.ko doesn't load properly here (regression against pre2 livecd)
* Find out exact requirements for Intel framebuffer
* Reduce dhcpcd timeout. The boot process appears to hang when there is no DHCP server in the network.
* Add raid-tools
* Add distcc
* Remove .bash_history and /var/log/{btmp,wtmp}
* Have version dynamically added (at end of build) to isolinux's boot.msg
* Change /etc/issue information to acknowledge work done by the new livecd team as well.
  Should we list team members?

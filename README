LFS LiveCD

------------------

I. Introduction

  There have been many livecds (aka bootcds) made and used within
the LFS community. Of particular note were Chris Lingard's and
Jeremy Utley's. By some random freak of chance, however, and perhaps a
bit of persistence on my part, a cd of mine was chosen to be used as the
'official' LFS cd with the release of LFS 6.0.

  I based much of my work on the ideas and work of Chris and Jeremy,
and from suggestions and comments from various LFSers, but the cd has been
still largely my work.  However, for the idea of an official cd to survive
and grow within the community, help and ideas need to continue to come
from more than just one source.

  My intention with the LFS livecd project, then, is to devise a
framework, a usable setting in which others may contribute and build cds
that live up to the official standard.

I. Introduction

  There have been many LiveCDs (aka BootCDs) made and used within the LFS
community. Of particular note were Chris Lingard's and Jeremy Utley's. By some
random freak of chance, and perhaps a bit of persistence on my part, a CD of
mine was chosen to be used as the 'Official' LFS CD with the release of
LFS 6.0.

  I based much of my work on the ideas and work of Chris and Jeremy, and from
suggestions and comments from various LFS users, but the originalCD had still
been largely my work. However, for the idea of an official CD to survive and
grow within the community, help and ideas need to continue to come from more
than just one source.

  My intention with the LFS LiveCD project, then, was to devise a framework, a
usable setting in which others may contribute and build CDs that live up to the
official standard. Originally, the idea was just to keep config files and a
list of required packages in a Subversion repository. What actually happened
was that a fully automated scripting system was devised specifically for the
purpose of building the LiveCD iso. This allows both an easily repeatable way
of building the CD and a means to track its configuration and history.

  Many thanks to all who have contributed to the production of these Makefiles
(and the CDs they in turn produce) by either suggestions, ideas, support, or
submitted edits.

II. Using the Makefiles

A. How These Makefiles Work

  There is one main Makefile at the top-level of this directory that controls
the build. It contains the instructions to control and direct the build,
including the order in which the packages are built. It also contains variables
that are used throughout the build. Inside the packages directory there is
a sub-directory for each package the LiveCD will build and install. Each of
those directories contains a Makefile specific for that package, with the
specific instructions it needs in order to compile. Any patches which that
package needs (and which are not part of the LFS or BLFS books) are included
in that directory as well.

  Part of the build is run as an unprivileged user, 'lfs', and the rest is
done after chroot-ing into the $(MP) directory (see the Configuring the
Environment section for information about $(MP) and other variables). In order
to make that happen, the Makefile approximately runs "su - lfs -c '[commands]'"
or "chroot $(MP) /bin/bash -c '[commands]'" where [commands] is the
instructions necessary to cd into the proper directory and re-run 'make' with
the proper target. So the Makefile is essentially re-calling itself as a
different user or in a different environment.

  In the correct order, and in the proper environment, each package's Makefile
is called and run. These download the source files it needs, verifies that
they are correct via sha1sum, unpacks the tarballs into its own directory,
runs the build instructions and sends the output into a log-file.

B. Configuring the Environment

  You should visually inspect the main Makefile, the one in the same directory
as this README before attempting to run the scripts. There are a few variables
that you may want to customize to meet the needs of your own particular setup
and for the type of CD you are hoping to produce. Here's a list of the main
variables to look for:

* VERSION
  This variable will be used in various places throughout the build and
should equal the version of the CD you intend to build. If you are building
this CD for personal use, you can enter anything here. LFS LiveCD editors will
follow a specific versioning scheme.

* KVERS
  This is the version of the Linux kernel to include on the CD

* MP
  This is the Mount Point, the directory that you will be using to house the
build as it runs. These scripts (this entire directory and its sub-directories)
should be placed inside the MP directory and run from there. Default is
/mnt/lfs.

* ROOT
  This signifies the root-point of the build scripts. In other words, this
is the name of the actual directory containing the build scripts. Default is
/lfs-livecd. If you accept the defaults for both this variable and MP, then
this directory and all its sub-directories should exist as 'lfs-livecd' within
the direcotry '/mnt/lfs'. It is important that this variable have a leading
'/' as it is referenced by the scripts in both the host environment and the
chroot environment.

* PM
  This is the level of parallel building you want make to use for each
package. Default is -j3, but you may wish to increase or decrease it slightly
as the case may be.

Any of the other variables could be changed, but that isn't recommended. Some
of them are crucial to the successful building of the CD, especially the ones
containing environment variables.

C. Obtaining the Sources

  The scripts will attempt to download the sources as it needs them. Since it
is highly unlikely that you will have all the correct sources already
downloaded to your system, a working internet connection is almost a
necessity when using these scripts.

  If you want to gather the source packages you'll need beforehand, you will
need to create a directory called 'sources' in the $(MP) directory and place
your packages there. You should either ensure that you download the *exact*
same package from the same URL the scripts use, or you should verify that
the SHA1 sum in that package's Makefile matches the tarball you have
downloaded.

D. Running the Scripts

  Building the CD could be as simple as the following:

mkdir /mnt/lfs
cd /mnt/lfs
svn co svn://svn.linuxfromscratch.org/livecd/[path of repo] lfs-livecd
(or, 'tar -xjf [path to tarball]'if you have downloaded a tarball of these
scripts)
cd /mnt/lfs/lfs-livecd
make

  The above example makes use of the default variables for $(MP) and $(ROOT).

LFS LiveCD

------------------

I. Introduction

  There have been many livecds (aka bootcds) made and used within
the LFS community. Of particular note were Chris Lingard's and
Jeremy Utley's. By some random freak of chance, however, and perhaps a
bit of persistence on my part, a cd of mine was chosen to be used as the
'official' LFS cd with the release of LFS 6.0.

  I based much of my work on the ideas and work of Chris and Jeremy,
and from suggestions and comments from various LFSers, but the cd has been
still largely my work.  However, for the idea of an official cd to survive
and grow within the community, help and ideas need to continue to come
from more than just one source.

  My intention with the LFS livecd project, then, is to devise a
framework, a usable setting in which others may contribute and build cds
that live up to the official standard.

II. Software

  An official LFS livecd will contain the following software as a minimum:

An LFS base system

An HTML version of the LFS book

The X Window System Environment

Web Tools
  * Wget
  * Lynx
  * Irssi
  * Firefox
  * Xchat

Text Editors
  * Vim
  * Nano

Network Tools
  * SSH Server and Client
  * NFS Server and Client
  * Smbmount (mount.cifs) for Windows shares
  * Subversion
  * Dhcpcd (DHCP client)

Filesystem Programs
  * Reiserfsprogs
  * Xfsprogs

nALFS - A tool for automating LFS builds

III. Building the livecd using these Makefiles

  Before you begin building the livecd, you should make sure of the following:

* The kernel running on your host system should be the same version for the
  target cd. We need this so that Xorg compiles and runs correctly. This
  version of the livecd uses linux-2.6.10.

* Be sure to have your compiled kernel source tree located at /usr/src/linux
  This is so that a kernel module can be built and installed that will force
  uname to return i486 as your system architecture.  This has the desired
  effect of easily producing binaries compatible with 486 machines and later.

* These Makefiles rely heavily on an active internet connection.

* Verify that this directory is called 'lfs-livecd' and is located in the 
  top of your lfs partition.  For example, if your lfs partition is mounted
  at /mnt/lfs this directory should be /mnt/lfs/lfs-livecd. You can change
  the name of this directory if you like, but if you do, be sure to edit the
  ROOT variable in top-level Makefile to match (include the beginning '/'). 

  To start the build, simply run:

	make

IV. Basic Installation Steps

  I've moved this section from the README and placed it online. You can read
it here for now: http://linuxfromscratch.org/~jhuntwork/livecd/

  The purpose of the page linked above is to provide general notes for the
techniques used in producing the Official LFS LiveCD.
